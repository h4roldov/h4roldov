## Hi there 👋

I’m Haroldo Vivallo.

Software Engineer based in Chile, with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence.

Before focusing deeply on AI-native development, I spent several years building production systems for both the **public and private sectors**, mainly using **Python and JavaScript**. That work shaped how I think about software: reliability, clarity, and systems that survive real constraints.

Today, my work has naturally evolved toward **AI-first products**, where LLMs are not an add-on but a core building block. Recently, I’ve been using **Claude Code** extensively as both a development and reasoning environment, combining engineering, product thinking, and applied AI.

Current projects:
- DentRead — AI-powered dental radiograph analysis platform  
  https://dentread.app
- Keyvo — secure password and secret sharing  
  https://keyvo.link
- Noledg — minimalist note-taking and knowledge app  
  https://noledg.com

I’m interested in AI-native tooling, LLM-first workflows, knowledge systems, and building simple products that scale conceptually over time.
