## Hi there 👋  
I’m Haroldo Vivallo.

### Background
I’m a Software Engineer based in Chile, with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. I’ve spent several years building and maintaining production systems for both public and private sectors. That experience shaped how I approach software: reliability over novelty, clarity over cleverness, and systems designed to survive real-world constraints.

### Current Focus
My work has gradually shifted toward **AI-native development**, where LLMs are part of the execution layer rather than an add-on.

I’m currently exploring:
- Context engineering as a design discipline  
- Product discovery with AI support  
- Better ways of understanding user intent and translating it into software requirements  
- How requirements can evolve over time with AI in the loop  

Alongside building, I’m also studying topics that complement this work, including:
- Anthropic courses on AI Fluency and Claude Code  
- ISO IEC 42001 and related AI governance topics  

I’m still very much in an exploratory phase, testing ideas and approaches rather than claiming definitive answers.

Previously, limited time and gaps in specific technologies often left personal projects unfinished. Working with Claude Code as a development and reasoning environment has made it easier to move forward, revisit ideas, and actually ship things, without losing technical judgment along the way.

### AI Assistance
AI was used to assist with structure and wording.  
Final content and intent are my own.
