## Hi there 👋  
I’m Haroldo Vivallo.

### Background
I’m a Software Engineer based in Chile, with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. I’ve spent several years building and maintaining production systems for both public and private sectors. That experience shaped how I approach software: reliability over novelty, clarity over cleverness, and systems designed to survive real-world constraints.

### Current Focus
My work has gradually shifted toward AI-native development, where LLMs are part of the execution layer rather than an add-on.

I’m currently exploring context engineering, product discovery with AI support, and better ways of understanding user intent and translating it into software requirements. I’m also studying Anthropic courses on AI Fluency and Claude Code, along with ISO IEC 42001 and related AI governance topics.

I’m still in an exploratory phase, testing ideas and approaches rather than claiming definitive answers.

---

Previously, limited time and gaps in specific technologies often left personal projects unfinished. Working with Claude Code as a development and reasoning environment has made it easier to move forward, revisit ideas, and actually ship things without losing technical judgment.

### AI Assistance
AI was used to assist with structure and wording.  
Final content and intent are my own.
